# Read Reference Instructions.pdf

To be concise,
This repository is a solution to reference instructions.pdf
We create an environment(a game) and different RL (Reinforcement Learning) agents that can interact (play).
The following are the three RL agents that have been implemented.
- Monte Carlo
- Backward-view Sarsa lambda
- Backward-view Sarsa lambda using a linear function approximator

A human being can also play the game with or without the assist of any of the agents.
